# Greenfoot API has two methods of coding to get a player to get in volved in the game

greenfoot.getKey() and greenfoot.isKeyDown(keyName)

 These two methods do the same thing, but are coded very differently in Java. The greenfoot.isKeyDown(keyName) is straight forward -- it can be called by writing a straight forward statement lets say greenfoot.isKeyDown("left");. The getKey() method is complicated. There is code to call in getKey.java which demonstrates how to call getKey(). The program will need proper java environment to run.
