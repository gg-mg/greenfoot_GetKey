# Greenfoot API has two methods greenfoot.getKey() and greenfoot.isKeyDown(keyName)

 which are similar buy coded very differently in Java. While greenfoot.isKeyDown(keyName) is straight forward, it can be called by lets say greenfoot.isKeyDown("left"); the getKey() method is complicated. I have written the code to call in getKey.java. The program will need proper java environment to run.
